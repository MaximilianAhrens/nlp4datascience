This is a python (and cython) based toolbox that enables data analysis and time-series predictions based on numerical and textual data inputs.
A range of machine learning (ML) methods are being implemented for regression and classification tasks.

=== CURRENTLY IN EARLY BETA MODE ===

MODELS
The following ML methods are being implemented:
	- OLS linear regression
	- LASSO
	- Elastic-Net
	- Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
	- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
	- supervised LDA (sLDA)
	- Hierachical Dirichlet Process (HDP)
	- Bayesian Topic Regression (BTR)
	- Generalized Bayesian Topic Regression (GBTR)
	- LSTM (options: bidirectional, attentional)
	- BERT
	- GPT2
	- XLNet

INFERENCE PROCEDURES
The following approximation methods are being implemented for Bayesian 
inference of the posterior distribution:
	- Gibbs sampling
	- Stochastic Variational Inference with Online Learning
